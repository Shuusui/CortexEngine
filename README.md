CortexEngine


At the moment the only way is to hardcode a project where you can add 1 object with an .obj file and a diffuse texture by ur choice. I plan to include some more mapping to the engine like normal mapping. After that I want to increase the objects I can display in the renderer. 

This engine is still work in progress and only for learning purpose.
